# NumPyRandomShapes3D
Generate 3D NumPy array with random shapes


# Special requirements
In addition to the usual dependencies (Numpy, OpenCV, SciPy), we use the following libraries :
* [NumPyDraw](https://github.com/Cyril-Meyer/NumPyDraw)  
Draw 2D and 3D shapes into NumPy array. (submodule)
* [perlin-numpy](https://github.com/pvigier/perlin-numpy)  
A fast and simple perlin noise generator using numpy. (pip install)
* [elasticdeform](https://github.com/gvtulder/elasticdeform)  
Elastic deformations for N-dimensional images. (pip install)
